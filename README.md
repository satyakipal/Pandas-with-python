# Pandas-with-python
Python is a great language for doing data analysis, primarily because of the fantastic ecosystem of data-centric Python packages. Pandas is one of those packages, and makes importing and analyzing data much easier. Pandas builds on packages like NumPy and matplotlib to give you a single, convenient, place to do most of your data analysis and visualization work.
